# Testing Documentation for User Authentication Flow

This document outlines the testing procedures for the User Authentication Flow in the FastAPI application, covering OAuth redirection, session management, and logout functionality.

## Setting Up the Testing Environment

- Ensure `pytest` and other necessary testing libraries are installed.
- Set up a test configuration that targets a test database and mocks external services like GitHub.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. OAuth Redirection Test

**Objective**: Verify correct redirection to GitHub for OAuth.

**Method**:
- Send a request to the OAuth redirection endpoint.
- Assert the response status code and redirection URL.

### 2. OAuth Callback and Token Exchange Test

**Objective**: Ensure proper handling of the authorization code and token exchange.

**Method**:
- Mock GitHub's token exchange endpoint.
- Send a mock authorization code to the callback endpoint.
- Verify the token exchange and error handling.

### 3. User Session Creation Test

**Objective**: Confirm correct creation and storage of user sessions.

**Method**:
- After a successful mock token exchange, check the database for the new session.
- Assert that the session contains correct user details.

### 4. User Data Storage Test

**Objective**: Check accurate storage and update of user data.

**Method**:
- Mock GitHub user profile response.
- After authentication, verify database updates for user information.

### 5. Logout Functionality Test

**Objective**: Test the effectiveness of the logout process.

**Method**:
- Create a session and perform a logout request.
- Assert that the session is invalidated in the database.

### 6. Error Handling and Validation Test

**Objective**: Validate robust error handling and data validation.

**Method**:
- Introduce various error scenarios.
- Assert that the application responds appropriately.

### 7. Security Tests

**Objective**: Ensure the application's security measures are effective.

**Method**:
- Test HTTPS redirection, CSRF protection, and secure token handling.
- Simulate common vulnerabilities and assert security responses.

## Continuous Integration

- Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automatically run tests on code changes.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
